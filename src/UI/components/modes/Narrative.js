                            <p>But there is a big issue currently highly coupled with energy consumption, <strong>CO‚ÇÇ
                                emissions</strong>. üè≠</p>
                            <p>Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted through human activities. CO‚ÇÇ emissions are carbon dioxide that planes, cars, factories, etc. produce, thought to be harmful to planet Earth.</p>
                            <p>Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) is released into Earth‚Äôs atmosphere mostly by the burning of carbon-containing fuels and the decay of wood and other plant matter. Under all conditions found naturally on Earth, CO‚ÇÇ is an invisible, odorless gas. It is removed from the atmosphere mostly by plants, which extract carbon from CO2 to build their tissues, and by the oceans, in which CO2 dissolves.</p>

                            <p>It‚Äôs widely recognised that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world urgently needs to reduce its emissions.</p>
                            <p>Note the weird trick, since we started looking after CO‚ÇÇ emissions in the 90's, we
                                took
                                CO‚ÇÇ emissions to another planet. </p>
